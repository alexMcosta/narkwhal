Narkwhal goes through your AWS account using the AWS SDK looking for available EBS volumes in the specified region and deletes them.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Narkwhal makes use of the AWS credentials folder. More information on this at the following link, [AWS Credentials folder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#creating-the-credentials-file)

- Go. This has been only tested and confirmed to work on 1.11 and newer

### Installing on Mac

Clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/alexMcosta/narkwhal.git
```

Then from `github.com/alexMcosta/narkwhal` do
```
go build
```

From the same directory you can now enter:
```
./narkwhal
```

If you see the following then it is working and tells you the commands
```
Usage of ./narkwhal:
  -account string
    	Lets you select witch AWS account you would like to make changes to (default "default")
  -region string
    	Lets you select which region you would like to run Narkwhal on (default "us-east-1")
```

Example of EBS volumes found and successful removal:
```
$ ./narkwhal -region ap-northeast-1                                                                          2 â†µ
account: default, region: ap-northeast-1
---------------------
vol-0466fbaa999d132a6
---------------------
Would you like to remove the above EBS Volumes? (y/n):
y
Successfully removed vol-0466fbaa999d132a6
```

Example of no available EBS volumes in the region:
```
$ ./narkwhal -region ap-northeast-1
account: default, region: ap-northeast-1
---------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~()~~~~~~
EXITING: There are no available EBS volumes in the ap-northeast-1 region to remove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~()~~~~~~
---------------------
```

### Feature Ideas
- [X] Add flag for choosing which account in `.aws/credentials` folder.
- [X] Add flag for choosing region
- Add the ability to scour all regions
- Add the ability to scour all accounts
- Add flag for time stamp date
- Add flag for either choosing specific id's or all EBS volumes
- Cache session to cut on calls
- Make binaries to install on multiple platforms so it does not require go
